### Project Goal
This project aims to implement decision trees, random forest and calculate evaluation features such as sensitivity, 
specificity, precision, recall and F-scores.

### Details
* Command line inputs train.file and test.file two arguments.
* In the procedure of building the tree, Gini-index is used as criterion.
* Random forest randomly selects variables at each split and does bootstrapping.
